Subject : Hackaton (2018)

Presentation of the subject
For this project, we have retrieved datasets about the hackatons that took place in the US in may 2018, provided by Prof Alex Nolte. We will use 3 datasets containing information about: the participants, the projects, and about the hackaton itself. With the recovered elements we will try to answer the following two questions in a user-friendly format:
                - Which hackaton has the highest average skill level of the participants?
                - Which are the top 10 states (in order) with the most participants in hackatons?
