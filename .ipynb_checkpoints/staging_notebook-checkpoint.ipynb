At midnight, hacking begins and will continue until code freeze at midnight Saturday (with meals throughout the weekend, of course!). On Sunday there will be two rounds of judging, followed by the closing speakers and announcement of the winners!

       "8372   \\nHack UCSC is proud to announce its fourth annual hackathon, taking place on January 20 to 22, 2017. It will be held at the Porter Dining Hall, with other classrooms available throughout the event. Friday will consist of registering, eating, listening to the opening speakers, and meeting fellow Hack UCSC attendees. At midnight, hacking begins and will continue until code freeze at midnight Saturday (with meals throughout the weekend, of course!). On Sunday there will be two rounds of judging, followed by the closing speakers and announcement of the winners! This is a great opportunity to meet people interested in the same kinds of software development as you, as well as those with an entirely different set of interests, form teams, and create your very own projects!   \n",
