637cf0e069d39c94132a81e9,,False,6,,"We scraped various open source datasets for gathering a holistic corpus for children across all age groups. We then applied a clustering mechanism and ranked similar topics according to their difficulties. For now, we have focussed on 2 age groups - children upto the age of 10, and children in the age group 10 to 13. After getting the difficulty rankings, we segregated our corpus according to the age groups and these difficulty scores - to get topics such as animals, plants and fruits to name a few, for younger kids, while getting more advanced topics such as literature, architecture and famous personalities for older children.
To generate questions from the corpus, we used state-of-the-art deep learning tools based on works such as this on neural question generation. The key idea is to use recurrent neural network-based autoencoders with global attention to allow the decoder to focus on particular words while generating a question. We adapted the model to work on sentences rather than to work on paragraphs. The motive behind this was twofold - it allowed us to generate more questions on a small corpus, and the questions generated are easy enough to be answered without any extraneous information.
For matching our answers with the answers provided by children, we have used a simple similarity metric of counting the common nouns in both the answer extracted from the corpus, and the answer said by children. For hosting each of our services, we have used Amazon’s OAuth service for authenticating and storing users’ statistics and tested questions. We have two servers running, one handling the previous portion, and the second being the server that communicates with Alexa regarding which question to pose next, and the answer it receives, and all involved computations. We had a small session with children in and just out of the age group to perceive their vocabulary skills in order to modulate Alexa’s input.",https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa,amazon-alexa,,flask-ask,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask,flask,,tensorflow,,theano,,luarocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kids can trigger the service by saying ALEXA, start ceramic AI.

It is connected with a web-app linked with Amazon OAuth, allowing parents to monitor their children’s performance, and suggests possible improvements in areas. It can also be linked with some incentive, such as credits on Amazon Apps, which further encourages children to use our system often. And it is not just any AI; ceramic AI remembers where the kid left off, if they go away in between or stop playing for some time. Our question generation mechanism has been incorporated with some randomness, so that the questions generated are not in perfect English, and are humorous in many circumstances.",,AlexaCeramic,"Children often skip school for multiple reasons nowadays. We intend to help fill the gaps between their skipped education by encouraging them to learn more in their free time at home, in one of the most fun ways! Alexa’s lucid voice modulation and ease of use allow transferring facts in an interesting yet simple manner. Using the Alexa Voice Skills API, we have transformed current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to present general knowledge for children in the form of questions and answers. These are generated from a corpus collected from various authentic sources available for children-centric information. The content for kids is segregated into various difficulty levels. Parents can easily track their children’s progress using our portal. They can even request adding a new topic: all they need to do is to specify the topic, and it will automatically be scraped and incorporated into Alexa’s model.

We ran into several challenges with people hacking our site when we launched it, and had to figure out how to increase the security on our site.","Calfessions was successfully launched at CalHacks, but we wish to increase the amount of users on our site by creating more confession pages for all events nearby in a specific geographic range. We also implemented the Twilio API in order to allow users to send an anonymous confession to a specific phone number, however we have yet to figure out how to ensure the person does not get spammed.

Confessions may range from romantic declarations to embarrassing stories, and from compliments to seeking or responding to advice.

In such a short period, people have difficulty finding the time or the space to meet all their hackers because they are spending all their time coding. Our website makes it quick and easy to interact with a variety of people from the event. In addition, the members of our community who are introverts or have a hard time initiating a conversation benefitted from Calfessions because they now have the opportunity to meet people in a less risky environment. Calfessions provides CalHackers an extra space for bonding and interaction among friends.","We learned how to create an end to end interactive website that can store data on a server. We became more knowledgable in creating a clean and sleek UI/UX design. We also learned how to integrate APIs into JavaScript that we were able to use in our product, such as Twillio and Facebook's login API. This process helped us grow as coders teaching us how to work in a team dynamic as well as how to learn and grow from others' abilities and skills. Even though this hackathon was very challenging, the difficulty allowed us to learn so much about web development even though some of us already had prior experience. Those that had no knowledge of web development also gained so much from this experience having built and created their first website.","In the first 24 hours of our launch, we had over 100 active users on our website, and over 100 confessions in the first 10 minutes alone. We learned how to make a smart system with remarkable security due to the immense amount of hack attempts. We integrated Twilio and Facebook's login APIs without having any prior knowledge of them.

It recognized the text from the image, though not perfectly. We then feed the recognized text to a Spell Check from Azure to further improve the quality of the text. Next, we used Azure Image Search service to look up the dish image from Bing, and then we used Alamofire and SwiftyJSON for getting the image. We created a virtual card using SceneKit and place it above the menu in ARView. We used Firebase as backend database and for authentication. We built some interactions between the virtual card and users so that users could see more information about the ordered dishes.",https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift,swift,,arkit,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure,azure,,cognitive,,image,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios,ios,,computer-vision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We ran into various unexpected challenges when developing Augmented Reality and using APIs. First, there are very few documentations about how to use Microsoft APIs on iOS apps. We learned how to use the third-party library for building HTTP request and parsing JSON files. Second, we had a really hard time understanding how Augmented Reality works in general, and how to place virtual card within SceneKit. Last, we were challenged to develop the same project as a team! It was the first time each of us was pushed to use Git and Github and we learned so much from branches and version controls.","We desire to build more interactions with ARKit, including displaying a collection of dishes on 3D shelf, or cool animations that people can see how those favorite dishes were made. We also want to build a large-scale database for entering comments, ratings or any other related information about dishes! We are happy that Yelp and OpenTable bring us more closed to the restaurants. We are excited about our project because it will bring us more closed to our favorite food!",,https://calhacks4.devpost.com/,DishPlay,"Every project aims to solve a problem, and to solve people's concerns. When we walk into a restaurant, we are so concerned that not many photos are printed on the menu. However, we are always eager to find out what a food looks like. Surprisingly, including a nice-looking picture alongside a food item increases sells by 30% according to Rapp. So it's a big inconvenience for customers if they don't understand the name of a food. This is what we are aiming for! This is where we get into the field! We want to create a better impression on every customer and create a better customer-friendly restaurant society. We want every person to immediately know what they like to eat and the first impression of a specific food in a restaurant.","During the whole development time, we clearly learned how to create our own AR model, what is the structure of the ARScene, and also how to combine different API to achieve our main goal. First of all, we enhance our ability to coding in swift, especially for AR. Creating the objects in AR world teaches us the tree structure in AR, and the relationships among parent nodes and its children nodes. What's more, we get to learn swift deeper, specifically its MVC model. Last but not least, bugs teach us how to solve a problem in a team and how to minimize the probability of buggy code for next time. Most importantly, this hackathon poses the strength of teamwork.","Only learning swift and ios development for one month, we create our very first wonderful AR app. This is a big challenge for us and we still choose a difficult and high-tech field, which should be most proud of. In addition, we implement lots of API and create a lot of ""objects"" in AR, and they both work perfectly. We also encountered few bugs during development, but we all try to fix them.

For 1.3 billion people, electricity access is a distant dream, and for 2 billion total, steady access is currently nonexistent. The largest concentration of people without energy access in the world is in India, particularly in the agrarian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where tens of millions live without access. The problem stems from infrastructure issues and incredible wastefulness. It seemed terrible to us when we read that about 30% of the electricity in rural power grids of India is wasted due to extreme inconsistencies. Very few people have constant access to energy, and everyone tries to access during certain hours. The way energy grids work, when many people want to tap into the grid at the same time, inefficiencies skyrocket. We intend to become the enablers for people in rural India who do not have normal or reliable access to electricity. We have all had a passion for energy access before coming to HackDuke, and believe that blockchain can revolutionize the energy access that rural areas are able to receive by making transactions safer and easier. Instead of coming up with an expensive, high-infrastructure solution like microgrids, however, we decided to make a product that can solve problems starting today. We were inspired by SMS-based products, because those are able to be implemented in the poorest regions globally.","We learned a lot about the problems faced in the energy sector, and about the challenges that come with new teamwork. We also learned that we really love working together and all truly care about the idea. Throughout, the more we read about energy deserts, problems that exists, and technologies that are emerging, we learned that we are extremely privileged with regards to power, and that the software and business skills that our team had can actually create a huge impact for millions of underprivileged people.","We are proud of creating a price equation based on the number of people requesting energy at a certain time and the amount being requested to create an equitable system. This equation allows us to level the playing field for all homes and decrease the 30% of waste that goes with these grids.

Yelp's API required us to make the requests from a server, pushing us to implement a back-end instead of keeping it all front-end. We also had a lot of issues sorting and picking restaurants from what Yelp provided us. There were numerous parameters that we had to keep track of: rating, number of stops, and distance. Rating would be a simple filter as we could just remove restaurants that were below our minimum rating threshold. The number of stops and number of stops posed a greater issue; we had to make sure we weren't making you go back and forth along your trip. Just because there's a 5 star restaurant close to your destination doesn't mean you want to go there first! Fudi groups the restaurants into distance categories and would pick the highest rating restaurant out of each category for you to visit. If multiple places had the same score, then whichever had more reviews would be chosen.","Ideally, we want Fudi to be able to account for all the different parameters that crazy foodies do when they plan their food runs. Additionally, Fudi should be able to filter out restaurants based on their categories. Our hope is that Fudi could potentially use machine learning, or some advanced mathematics at the least, in order to generate these routes and cater to the user's wants and needs as a foodie.","Fudi takes two locations, a starting and ending point, a price range, a minimum rating, and the number of stops that you would like to make during your trip. Fudi then generates a list of restaurants and diners that you should attend, leading you to your ending destination.",https://brh2017.devpost.com/,Fudi,"We all have that one friend who posts dozens of pictures of mouth watering food from their travels to the city. You know, the foodie friend who's always wanting to try the newest, hottest food from several different places in just a single day! The amount of planning and time it takes to perfect these food runs is ridiculous! They have to account for which restaurants they're going to dine at, whether they're open, how far each location is from another, and even peak hours in order to make sure they're not wasting hours sitting just to get a small item from the menu. That's where Fudi comes in.","We learned that Fudi requires a strong infrastructure to stand upon in order to properly function. Currently, a lot of the work is done on the client side of the program, when a lot of the workload should be placed on the server to prevent potential hanging on the client's side. We also learned that the thought process of foodies who meticulously plan out their routes is a lot more intricate than we expected it to be. They account for peak hours, closing times, other landmarks they'd like to see, and routes that lead them to a restaurant/place that's on the way to their destination.","Even though Fudi isn't all of what we had envisioned, we're proud that we were able to implement it's core feature in the amount of time we had.",2,BigRed//Hacks Fall 2017,Fudi allows you to efficiently explore and eat your around your favorite city.,https://github.com/fishnal/Foodie-Run-Mapper-BRH-2017,0,3,2017-09-17T03:14:17-04:00,"I worked full-stack from styling the webpage, to writing a Tornado server in Python, and to deploying on to Google App Engine.

Following that, our challenges came from implementation of different APIs, such as the Typeform API and Google Calendar API, as well as usage of Android Studio, which only one of our team members had some experience in.","Next up, additional features can be added to Lighthouse: Multiple languages to better cater to small clinics and healthcare systems in third-world countries. Additional appointment options to allow different healthcare services to utilize the same app: a patient may be able to use the same quick, efficient beacon check-in and patient history transfer at their doctor's appointment, dentist appointment, eye exam, and etc.","Lighthouse works with both the patient side and doctor side of organizing health services to automate the healthcare process:
On the patient side, a patient first installs our app with the incentive of decreasing their wait time and experiencing faster appointments. In the signup process, the patient enters their patient history just once, and this health history can be updated and reviewed in subsequent appointments and following any changes in health. After the patient signs up for an appointment with a doctor, their visit becomes automated. As they enter a waiting room, rather than checking in, the beacon senses that they are nearby and upon review of patient history, Lighthouse automatically checks them in, notifying their doctor. During the appointment, a beacon specific to a patient room will send out its specific UID to the doctor's device, prompting the doctor app to bring up the information regarding the specific patient.
On the doctor side, appointments populate a doctor's Google Calendar, which is accessed through Lighthouse. These appointments are without overlap and easily viewed amidst the rest of the doctor's non-patient calendar events. Each day, the doctor is able to view their appointments as they receive patient name and room number, making their schedule easy to access, understand, and use.",https://archhacks2017.devpost.com/,Lighthouse,"Our story begins with 2 Estimote beacons. A friend of ours introduced the team to beacons, which are pieces of hardware that can detect phones within a certain proximity. Placing beacons in a health hack context, we realized their great potential in expediting the patient-doctor experience that defines healthcare: beacons can use their unique proximity features to detect patients in waiting rooms without the need for paper sign-in, or detect patients in examination or hospital rooms, triggering an automatic sending of patient history and data to a visiting doctor. As a result, beacons have the capability of creating an automated healthcare network, which optimizes speed and efficiency in everyday healthcare operations.
Furthermore, this beacon healthcare network is low-cost and easy-to-use, having immense potential for bettering the health standards in environments that may lack the means to provide online, automated patient-doctor services, such as smaller clinics or hospitals in impoverished areas including third-world countries. As 2/3rds of the world uses smartphones, and each beacon costs around $15-20, any healthcare facility with wifi can implement this automated patient-doctor system.
Creating a network of closely-connected beacons and Android apps, we named our product Lighthouse to pay homage to the first beacon. Just as a lighthouse emits a light to direct the navigation of people by air and sea, our beacon-based apps emit signals to organize and elucidate the healthcare system of the everyday population.","We learned how to implement several APIs, such as for Estimote, Typeform, and Google Calendar in a short amount of time. Some of us learned the foundations of Android Studio. We all learned how to function on very little sleep and power through.","We're proud of learning how to use beacons, which are a piece of new hardware that we have never heard of or used before this weekend! We're also proud of debugging code that pertained to the different API calls we had to make, since each API had its own quirks and features.
In addition, we thought of a punny domain name: beacons led us to signals, which led us to morse code: .--.

We envisioned the Mind Labyrinth as an online space that acts as a virtual therapist, helping those who are conflicted to express their inner thoughts, let out their emotions, and ultimately, resolve themselves with 100% confidentiality.
We built the Mind Labyrinth on a domain given to one of us for an online course using a text editor with PHP processing and HTML and CSS for the website framework. We took special consideration into the visual aspect of this work, with the logo being hand drawn and later rendered in Photoshop Mobile, and the monochromatic colors chosen to prevent ’jarring’ or intimidating a user that is already in a likely striking situation (The background is chosen from subtlepatterns.com and the fonts are chosen from fonts.google.com accordingly.).",https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php,php,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html,html,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css,css,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This being our first hackathon for all four of our members meant that we went into this having a very bare knowledge of what to expect to do with the twelve hours given to work on our project.  The fact that we assembled a team within the first hour of the hackathon (with half of our members not having known each other) also meant that we were unsure as to what assets we all could bring to the table and what our team dynamic would result into. We spent the first two of those twelve hours frantically individually typing into a Google Doc ideas we had as a brainstorming technique (which retrospectively was probably not the greatest way to manage our time) before finding the idea of helping individuals with conflict resolution. That being said, by the end of the project we were all confident that we came out as better teammates in addition to being better hackers!","As individuals who are genuinely passionate about this never-ending issue, we plan on expanding the accessibility of the Mind Labyrinth and improving it by making the Labyrinth more complex. The first step is to contact real therapists and psychologists and have their input on how they consult with their patients. This way, we can develop more “routes” or “paths” in the labyrinth, allowing it to meet the needs of a larger variety of people and a larger variety of situations. We also plan on seeking funding/sponsorship to create a more accessible domain name so that we can have it appear on major search engines when people search things like how to best confront someone, deal with doubt in their relationships with other people, and similar situations. Although the motive of the Mind Labyrinth is simply to relieve one’s stress, little by little, we believe that it has the potential to change the lives of individuals across the globe.","The Mind Labyrinth is a simple-to-use online web application which prompts your responses and changes its questions according to what you likely feel the need to talk about the most. It is aimed at helping people facing peer-to-peer conflict who are unsure as to what to do next. Through guiding you through a process of calm thinking on your state of affairs, it ensures you  feel that you have complete understanding on your own self-actualization. Instead of directly telling you what to do, the Mind Labyrinth helps you to reflect on you actions and the consequences. This way, you can make the most rational decision based on your situation and your own perception of what would most likely happen next. Using this method, the Mind Labyrinth is able to help with a large group of individuals facing a variety of personal situations.
We believe that if The Mind Labyrinth were used frequently by people around the globe to help logically mediate their choices, the world would be a better place for all.",https://localhackdayiii.devpost.com/,Mind Labyrinth,"As high school students ourselves, we experience a great amount of stress on a daily basis which can be triggered by many factors. Ranging from a large workload, to internal and external conflicts with other angsty individuals, to a lack of sleep, we have oftentimes found that the stress from these conflicts overwhelms our ability to react to bad situations in a constructive way. A study done by the center for adolescent help found that the five stressors most commonly felt by adolescents were school work (78%), parents (68%), romantic relationships (64%), friends’ problems (64%), and younger siblings (64%).
(","This may have been our first hackathon, but it certainly won't be our last! Overall, all of our team members came to a consensus at the end of the awards ceremony that we had progressed as individuals on our general problem solving, collaboration, and initiative skills. Specifically, we also all became more proficient in website building, as we all collaborated on creating every element of the website as a team.","Although we only had 12 hours to create an extravagant project, we were able to do so with minimal problems and we were productive throughout the day. Starting off having no idea what we were going to make, we ended up with a great project that every team member was proud of and was happy with. In addition to that, it was our first time meeting each other, so our ability to cooperate and work well with a new group of people that we had just met was something to be proud of. As a team of students sharing the same interests, we were able to overcome challenges that we faced, and along the way know more about each other and discover new things about ourselves as well. 
We managed to fulfill many of our personal goals, have a lot of fun during the process, and create a project beyond what we had expected first entering into the hackathon. We have also received public recognition for our efforts by receiving the “Best First Time Hack” award at Iroquois Ridge High School on December 3rd during Local Hack Day, something which left us all just as satisfied at the end of the day as the character development we felt we all achieved.",2,Local Hack Day III,"Free, 100% confidential self-mediation for conflicted individuals.",,0,3,2016-12-04T22:52:42-05:00,,Sohpei Wu,,https://devpost.com/sohpei,sohpei,,Niya Xu,,https://devpost.com/xnyjjx,xnyjjx,,Carol Chu,,https://devpost.com/carolchu,carolchu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://devpost.com/software/mind-labyrinth-x5hpw8,mind-labyrinth-x5hpw8

So we thought up of a way to raise money (and continuously!) to help these people in need with the advent of a digital currency known as Monero. And the best part is that you don't even have to spend a single cent. Mine for Puerto Rico allows anyone who goes onto our website to dedicate a portion (anywhere from 0-100%) of their CPU processing power to mine for digital currency, allowing the user to use their computers at ease while they raise money for helping out this very urgent humanitarian crisis. The money will be stored into a digital wallet and so the more users we get to go onto the site, the more amount of money that gets generated! So to really make an impact (and we cannot stress this enough) this would have to be a COLLECTIVE EFFORT.

For the front-end, we used html, css for the display, and javascript/jquery to make the app more responsive. To handle the back-end, we explored a JSON-based database called Firebase, which uses AngularJS. Most of the native-app-plugins were installed using cordova, and we implemented different API's from google and firebase to polish our application. We initially thought about handling the back-end using PHP and MySQL through ajax queries in javacscript, we figured that it would be too complicated since cordova doesn't support PHP.

Three of the four group members on our team have only meddled with html enough to print out ""Hello World!"", let alone css, cordova, onsen, firebase, and angular js. It is safe to assume that the team spent 70% of the Hackathon learning the syntax and nature of each language. On top of which, many features we wanted to implement required heavy use of online APIs. I think at this point, every one of us feel like we've read textbooks worth of documentations.","Stress aside, we all really enjoyed coding pointME. The project started off as an off hand idea and evolved into something we are all very proud to present. Of course, we will continue to upgrade and refine the app. We have many more functions such as car-pooling, estimation time to destination, and having every event placed neatly in a calendar. Until it is ready enough for us to seriously consider the business side of it. Our goal is to release/sell the app early 2017.","pointME allows users to create an event, and upon doing so, this creates an appointment where the user can chat with other event attendees, share files, and get directions to the event location. Each appointment also has a shareable link that is used to invite others to the event through Facebook. Most importantly, the appointment shows the location of the attendees via geolocation prior to the event, allowing easy visualization of who will be able to make it to the appointment on time, which the organizer and others can see to avoid hectic group messaging.",https://hophacks-spring-2016.devpost.com/,pointME,"Often times, our phones “blow up” with notifications from last-minute messaging before an event or meeting. It’s difficult, especially for the organizer, to keep track of who is running late or may have to cancel last-minute. We wanted to create an event-planning app that would help avoid this hassle. The original idea actually sprouted from one of our teammates when he was running late for his meeting and he did not want to message the entire club.","Oh man, where do I begin? As mentioned before, the team members have definitely developed a much more indepth understanding of web-app development. From front end coding to UI organization to collecting back end data. We feel like we grasped a much better idea of this industry, gained a ton of respect for others and are very inspired to continue to work in this genre. I think the most valuable lesson we learned is just how effective a team can be when everyone is easy going and works diligently on their task.","We’re extremely proud of all the features we were able to implement, even with our limited experience in web-app development.

Using OneSheeld, a kind of Arduino shield, we were able to connect the phone to Arduino where we could call on camera functions to take the picture and Twitter functions to upload them. 
Essentially, in our code we had a while loop that called analogRead to continuously read the pressure sensors in order to check if the squirrel had stepped into the box. If the analogRead reading were below the threshold then thew turn flash off, take picture and upload to twitter functions were called. These three functions were placed within an if statement of the analog readings being lower than the threshold, so they would only be activated if the sensor was triggered.

637cf2042454d12e9d610920,,False,6,,"We scraped various open source datasets for gathering a holistic corpus for children across all age groups. We then applied a clustering mechanism and ranked similar topics according to their difficulties. For now, we have focussed on 2 age groups - children upto the age of 10, and children in the age group 10 to 13. After getting the difficulty rankings, we segregated our corpus according to the age groups and these difficulty scores - to get topics such as animals, plants and fruits to name a few, for younger kids, while getting more advanced topics such as literature, architecture and famous personalities for older children.
To generate questions from the corpus, we used state-of-the-art deep learning tools based on works such as this on neural question generation. The key idea is to use recurrent neural network-based autoencoders with global attention to allow the decoder to focus on particular words while generating a question. We adapted the model to work on sentences rather than to work on paragraphs. The motive behind this was twofold - it allowed us to generate more questions on a small corpus, and the questions generated are easy enough to be answered without any extraneous information.
For matching our answers with the answers provided by children, we have used a simple similarity metric of counting the common nouns in both the answer extracted from the corpus, and the answer said by children. For hosting each of our services, we have used Amazon’s OAuth service for authenticating and storing users’ statistics and tested questions. We have two servers running, one handling the previous portion, and the second being the server that communicates with Alexa regarding which question to pose next, and the answer it receives, and all involved computations. We had a small session with children in and just out of the age group to perceive their vocabulary skills in order to modulate Alexa’s input.",https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa,amazon-alexa,,flask-ask,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask,flask,,tensorflow,,theano,,luarocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kids can trigger the service by saying ALEXA, start ceramic AI.

It is connected with a web-app linked with Amazon OAuth, allowing parents to monitor their children’s performance, and suggests possible improvements in areas. It can also be linked with some incentive, such as credits on Amazon Apps, which further encourages children to use our system often. And it is not just any AI; ceramic AI remembers where the kid left off, if they go away in between or stop playing for some time. Our question generation mechanism has been incorporated with some randomness, so that the questions generated are not in perfect English, and are humorous in many circumstances.",,AlexaCeramic,"Children often skip school for multiple reasons nowadays. We intend to help fill the gaps between their skipped education by encouraging them to learn more in their free time at home, in one of the most fun ways!

Using the Alexa Voice Skills API, we have transformed current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to present general knowledge for children in the form of questions and answers. These are generated from a corpus collected from various authentic sources available for children-centric information. The content for kids is segregated into various difficulty levels. Parents can easily track their children’s progress using our portal. They can even request adding a new topic: all they need to do is to specify the topic, and it will automatically be scraped and incorporated into Alexa’s model.

We ran into some trouble trying to get the Facebook login to work in our website, getting the Twillio API into our product, getting the up and down vote buttons to work, and adding a new entry and having it connect to our database. We ran into several challenges with people hacking our site when we launched it, and had to figure out how to increase the security on our site.","Calfessions was successfully launched at CalHacks, but we wish to increase the amount of users on our site by creating more confession pages for all events nearby in a specific geographic range. We also implemented the Twilio API in order to allow users to send an anonymous confession to a specific phone number, however we have yet to figure out how to ensure the person does not get spammed. We also want to use the Twilio API to allow users to log in with their phone number instead of Facebook. We implemented an upvote/downvote system, but have to figure out how to connect that with our database so that the ranking stays when the page is refreshed.","We have developed a website that allows Calhacks participants to share anonymous confessions. After logging into Facebook, a person may post their confession and upvote or downvote previous confessions. Confessions may range from romantic declarations to embarrassing stories, and from compliments to seeking or responding to advice. In a stressful event, such as CalHacks, it is hard to socialize with everyone. Through Calfessions, people can bond over similar questions, thoughts, and emotions – making the event come together as one community.",https://calhacks3.devpost.com/,Calfessions,"CalHacks is an event that brings together 1500 undergraduate students from all over the country for one weekend. In such a short period, people have difficulty finding the time or the space to meet all their hackers because they are spending all their time coding. Our website makes it quick and easy to interact with a variety of people from the event. In addition, the members of our community who are introverts or have a hard time initiating a conversation benefitted from Calfessions because they now have the opportunity to meet people in a less risky environment. Calfessions provides CalHackers an extra space for bonding and interaction among friends.","We learned how to create an end to end interactive website that can store data on a server. We became more knowledgable in creating a clean and sleek UI/UX design. We also learned how to integrate APIs into JavaScript that we were able to use in our product, such as Twillio and Facebook's login API. This process helped us grow as coders teaching us how to work in a team dynamic as well as how to learn and grow from others' abilities and skills. Even though this hackathon was very challenging, the difficulty allowed us to learn so much about web development even though some of us already had prior experience. Those that had no knowledge of web development also gained so much from this experience having built and created their first website.","In the first 24 hours of our launch, we had over 100 active users on our website, and over 100 confessions in the first 10 minutes alone. We learned how to make a smart system with remarkable security due to the immense amount of hack attempts. We integrated Twilio and Facebook's login APIs without having any prior knowledge of them. We learned how to debug and find errors in our code very quickly and efficiently, through using aids such as Chrome developer tools for JavaScript.",2,Cal Hacks 3.0,What's on your mind?,,0,2,2016-11-13T11:56:28-05:00,,Arshi Jujara,,https://devpost.com/ajujara,ajujara,,Chelsea Villanueva,,https://devpost.com/Chelv27,Chelv27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://devpost.com/software/calfessions,calfessions

Next, we used Azure Image Search service to look up the dish image from Bing, and then we used Alamofire and SwiftyJSON for getting the image. We created a virtual card using SceneKit and place it above the menu in ARView. We used Firebase as backend database and for authentication. We built some interactions between the virtual card and users so that users could see more information about the ordered dishes.",https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift,swift,,arkit,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure,azure,,cognitive,,image,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios,ios,,computer-vision,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We ran into various unexpected challenges when developing Augmented Reality and using APIs. First, there are very few documentations about how to use Microsoft APIs on iOS apps. We learned how to use the third-party library for building HTTP request and parsing JSON files. Second, we had a really hard time understanding how Augmented Reality works in general, and how to place virtual card within SceneKit. Last, we were challenged to develop the same project as a team! It was the first time each of us was pushed to use Git and Github and we learned so much from branches and version controls.","We desire to build more interactions with ARKit, including displaying a collection of dishes on 3D shelf, or cool animations that people can see how those favorite dishes were made. We also want to build a large-scale database for entering comments, ratings or any other related information about dishes! We are happy that Yelp and OpenTable bring us more closed to the restaurants. We are excited about our project because it will bring us more closed to our favorite food!",,https://calhacks4.devpost.com/,DishPlay,"Every project aims to solve a problem, and to solve people's concerns. When we walk into a restaurant, we are so concerned that not many photos are printed on the menu. However, we are always eager to find out what a food looks like. Surprisingly, including a nice-looking picture alongside a food item increases sells by 30% according to Rapp. So it's a big inconvenience for customers if they don't understand the name of a food. This is what we are aiming for! This is where we get into the field! We want to create a better impression on every customer and create a better customer-friendly restaurant society. We want every person to immediately know what they like to eat and the first impression of a specific food in a restaurant.","During the whole development time, we clearly learned how to create our own AR model, what is the structure of the ARScene, and also how to combine different API to achieve our main goal. First of all, we enhance our ability to coding in swift, especially for AR. Creating the objects in AR world teaches us the tree structure in AR, and the relationships among parent nodes and its children nodes. What's more, we get to learn swift deeper, specifically its MVC model. Last but not least, bugs teach us how to solve a problem in a team and how to minimize the probability of buggy code for next time. Most importantly, this hackathon poses the strength of teamwork.","Only learning swift and ios development for one month, we create our very first wonderful AR app. This is a big challenge for us and we still choose a difficult and high-tech field, which should be most proud of. In addition, we implement lots of API and create a lot of ""objects"" in AR, and they both work perfectly. We also encountered few bugs during development, but we all try to fix them.

We also ran into challenges learning how to use twilio with Flask and Heroku, but the process was both fun and rewarding.","We hope to do well in the competition and potentially enter the Duke Startup Challenge/Hult Prize this year.

Additionally, we intend to keep working on our customer value proposition, technology and operations management plan, go-to-market plan, and profit formula, which we feel capable of making with the research that we have done up to this point.","EnerGenius is an SMS-based service where consumers of energy can text directly to the power grid when they need to reserve or immediately have access to energy. They are then asked to enter their request in a specific format, and their energy request is put in to the power grid.",https://hackduke-2017.devpost.com/,EnerGenius,"Our team was inspired by the energy crisis that faces the world. For 1.3 billion people, electricity access is a distant dream, and for 2 billion total, steady access is currently nonexistent. The largest concentration of people without energy access in the world is in India, particularly in the agrarian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where tens of millions live without access. The problem stems from infrastructure issues and incredible wastefulness. It seemed terrible to us when we read that about 30% of the electricity in rural power grids of India is wasted due to extreme inconsistencies. Very few people have constant access to energy, and everyone tries to access during certain hours. The way energy grids work, when many people want to tap into the grid at the same time, inefficiencies skyrocket. We intend to become the enablers for people in rural India who do not have normal or reliable access to electricity. We have all had a passion for energy access before coming to HackDuke, and believe that blockchain can revolutionize the energy access that rural areas are able to receive by making transactions safer and easier. Instead of coming up with an expensive, high-infrastructure solution like microgrids, however, we decided to make a product that can solve problems starting today. We were inspired by SMS-based products, because those are able to be implemented in the poorest regions globally.","We learned a lot about the problems faced in the energy sector, and about the challenges that come with new teamwork. We also learned that we really love working together and all truly care about the idea. Throughout, the more we read about energy deserts, problems that exists, and technologies that are emerging, we learned that we are extremely privileged with regards to power, and that the software and business skills that our team had can actually create a huge impact for millions of underprivileged people.","We are proud of creating a price equation based on the number of people requesting energy at a certain time and the amount being requested to create an equitable system. This equation allows us to level the playing field for all homes and decrease the 30% of waste that goes with these grids.

Yelp's API required us to make the requests from a server, pushing us to implement a back-end instead of keeping it all front-end. We also had a lot of issues sorting and picking restaurants from what Yelp provided us. There were numerous parameters that we had to keep track of: rating, number of stops, and distance. Rating would be a simple filter as we could just remove restaurants that were below our minimum rating threshold. The number of stops and number of stops posed a greater issue; we had to make sure we weren't making you go back and forth along your trip. Just because there's a 5 star restaurant close to your destination doesn't mean you want to go there first! Fudi groups the restaurants into distance categories and would pick the highest rating restaurant out of each category for you to visit. If multiple places had the same score, then whichever had more reviews would be chosen.","Ideally, we want Fudi to be able to account for all the different parameters that crazy foodies do when they plan their food runs. Additionally, Fudi should be able to filter out restaurants based on their categories. Our hope is that Fudi could potentially use machine learning, or some advanced mathematics at the least, in order to generate these routes and cater to the user's wants and needs as a foodie.","Fudi takes two locations, a starting and ending point, a price range, a minimum rating, and the number of stops that you would like to make during your trip. Fudi then generates a list of restaurants and diners that you should attend, leading you to your ending destination.",https://brh2017.devpost.com/,Fudi,"We all have that one friend who posts dozens of pictures of mouth watering food from their travels to the city. You know, the foodie friend who's always wanting to try the newest, hottest food from several different places in just a single day! The amount of planning and time it takes to perfect these food runs is ridiculous! They have to account for which restaurants they're going to dine at, whether they're open, how far each location is from another, and even peak hours in order to make sure they're not wasting hours sitting just to get a small item from the menu. That's where Fudi comes in.","We learned that Fudi requires a strong infrastructure to stand upon in order to properly function. Currently, a lot of the work is done on the client side of the program, when a lot of the workload should be placed on the server to prevent potential hanging on the client's side. We also learned that the thought process of foodies who meticulously plan out their routes is a lot more intricate than we expected it to be. They account for peak hours, closing times, other landmarks they'd like to see, and routes that lead them to a restaurant/place that's on the way to their destination.","Even though Fudi isn't all of what we had envisioned, we're proud that we were able to implement it's core feature in the amount of time we had.",2,BigRed//Hacks Fall 2017,Fudi allows you to efficiently explore and eat your around your favorite city.,https://github.com/fishnal/Foodie-Run-Mapper-BRH-2017,0,3,2017-09-17T03:14:17-04:00,"I worked full-stack from styling the webpage, to writing a Tornado server in Python, and to deploying on to Google App Engine.

Following that, our challenges came from implementation of different APIs, such as the Typeform API and Google Calendar API, as well as usage of Android Studio, which only one of our team members had some experience in.","Next up, additional features can be added to Lighthouse: Multiple languages to better cater to small clinics and healthcare systems in third-world countries. Additional appointment options to allow different healthcare services to utilize the same app: a patient may be able to use the same quick, efficient beacon check-in and patient history transfer at their doctor's appointment, dentist appointment, eye exam, and etc.","Lighthouse works with both the patient side and doctor side of organizing health services to automate the healthcare process:
On the patient side, a patient first installs our app with the incentive of decreasing their wait time and experiencing faster appointments. In the signup process, the patient enters their patient history just once, and this health history can be updated and reviewed in subsequent appointments and following any changes in health. After the patient signs up for an appointment with a doctor, their visit becomes automated. As they enter a waiting room, rather than checking in, the beacon senses that they are nearby and upon review of patient history, Lighthouse automatically checks them in, notifying their doctor. During the appointment, a beacon specific to a patient room will send out its specific UID to the doctor's device, prompting the doctor app to bring up the information regarding the specific patient.
On the doctor side, appointments populate a doctor's Google Calendar, which is accessed through Lighthouse. These appointments are without overlap and easily viewed amidst the rest of the doctor's non-patient calendar events. Each day, the doctor is able to view their appointments as they receive patient name and room number, making their schedule easy to access, understand, and use.",https://archhacks2017.devpost.com/,Lighthouse,"Our story begins with 2 Estimote beacons. A friend of ours introduced the team to beacons, which are pieces of hardware that can detect phones within a certain proximity. Placing beacons in a health hack context, we realized their great potential in expediting the patient-doctor experience that defines healthcare: beacons can use their unique proximity features to detect patients in waiting rooms without the need for paper sign-in, or detect patients in examination or hospital rooms, triggering an automatic sending of patient history and data to a visiting doctor. As a result, beacons have the capability of creating an automated healthcare network, which optimizes speed and efficiency in everyday healthcare operations.
Furthermore, this beacon healthcare network is low-cost and easy-to-use, having immense potential for bettering the health standards in environments that may lack the means to provide online, automated patient-doctor services, such as smaller clinics or hospitals in impoverished areas including third-world countries. As 2/3rds of the world uses smartphones, and each beacon costs around $15-20, any healthcare facility with wifi can implement this automated patient-doctor system.
Creating a network of closely-connected beacons and Android apps, we named our product Lighthouse to pay homage to the first beacon. Just as a lighthouse emits a light to direct the navigation of people by air and sea, our beacon-based apps emit signals to organize and elucidate the healthcare system of the everyday population.","We learned how to implement several APIs, such as for Estimote, Typeform, and Google Calendar in a short amount of time. Some of us learned the foundations of Android Studio. We all learned how to function on very little sleep and power through.","We're proud of learning how to use beacons, which are a piece of new hardware that we have never heard of or used before this weekend! We're also proud of debugging code that pertained to the different API calls we had to make, since each API had its own quirks and features.
In addition, we thought of a punny domain name: beacons led us to signals, which led us to morse code: .--.

We envisioned the Mind Labyrinth as an online space that acts as a virtual therapist, helping those who are conflicted to express their inner thoughts, let out their emotions, and ultimately, resolve themselves with 100% confidentiality.
We built the Mind Labyrinth on a domain given to one of us for an online course using a text editor with PHP processing and HTML and CSS for the website framework. We took special consideration into the visual aspect of this work, with the logo being hand drawn and later rendered in Photoshop Mobile, and the monochromatic colors chosen to prevent ’jarring’ or intimidating a user that is already in a likely striking situation (The background is chosen from subtlepatterns.com and the fonts are chosen from fonts.google.com accordingly.).",https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php,php,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html,html,https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css,css,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This being our first hackathon for all four of our members meant that we went into this having a very bare knowledge of what to expect to do with the twelve hours given to work on our project.  The fact that we assembled a team within the first hour of the hackathon (with half of our members not having known each other) also meant that we were unsure as to what assets we all could bring to the table and what our team dynamic would result into. We spent the first two of those twelve hours frantically individually typing into a Google Doc ideas we had as a brainstorming technique (which retrospectively was probably not the greatest way to manage our time) before finding the idea of helping individuals with conflict resolution. That being said, by the end of the project we were all confident that we came out as better teammates in addition to being better hackers!","As individuals who are genuinely passionate about this never-ending issue, we plan on expanding the accessibility of the Mind Labyrinth and improving it by making the Labyrinth more complex. The first step is to contact real therapists and psychologists and have their input on how they consult with their patients. This way, we can develop more “routes” or “paths” in the labyrinth, allowing it to meet the needs of a larger variety of people and a larger variety of situations. We also plan on seeking funding/sponsorship to create a more accessible domain name so that we can have it appear on major search engines when people search things like how to best confront someone, deal with doubt in their relationships with other people, and similar situations. Although the motive of the Mind Labyrinth is simply to relieve one’s stress, little by little, we believe that it has the potential to change the lives of individuals across the globe.","The Mind Labyrinth is a simple-to-use online web application which prompts your responses and changes its questions according to what you likely feel the need to talk about the most. It is aimed at helping people facing peer-to-peer conflict who are unsure as to what to do next. Through guiding you through a process of calm thinking on your state of affairs, it ensures you  feel that you have complete understanding on your own self-actualization. Instead of directly telling you what to do, the Mind Labyrinth helps you to reflect on you actions and the consequences. This way, you can make the most rational decision based on your situation and your own perception of what would most likely happen next. Using this method, the Mind Labyrinth is able to help with a large group of individuals facing a variety of personal situations.
We believe that if The Mind Labyrinth were used frequently by people around the globe to help logically mediate their choices, the world would be a better place for all.",https://localhackdayiii.devpost.com/,Mind Labyrinth,"As high school students ourselves, we experience a great amount of stress on a daily basis which can be triggered by many factors. Ranging from a large workload, to internal and external conflicts with other angsty individuals, to a lack of sleep, we have oftentimes found that the stress from these conflicts overwhelms our ability to react to bad situations in a constructive way. A study done by the center for adolescent help found that the five stressors most commonly felt by adolescents were school work (78%), parents (68%), romantic relationships (64%), friends’ problems (64%), and younger siblings (64%).
(","This may have been our first hackathon, but it certainly won't be our last! Overall, all of our team members came to a consensus at the end of the awards ceremony that we had progressed as individuals on our general problem solving, collaboration, and initiative skills. Specifically, we also all became more proficient in website building, as we all collaborated on creating every element of the website as a team.","Although we only had 12 hours to create an extravagant project, we were able to do so with minimal problems and we were productive throughout the day. Starting off having no idea what we were going to make, we ended up with a great project that every team member was proud of and was happy with. In addition to that, it was our first time meeting each other, so our ability to cooperate and work well with a new group of people that we had just met was something to be proud of. As a team of students sharing the same interests, we were able to overcome challenges that we faced, and along the way know more about each other and discover new things about ourselves as well. 
We managed to fulfill many of our personal goals, have a lot of fun during the process, and create a project beyond what we had expected first entering into the hackathon. We have also received public recognition for our efforts by receiving the “Best First Time Hack” award at Iroquois Ridge High School on December 3rd during Local Hack Day, something which left us all just as satisfied at the end of the day as the character development we felt we all achieved.",2,Local Hack Day III,"Free, 100% confidential self-mediation for conflicted individuals.",,0,3,2016-12-04T22:52:42-05:00,,Sohpei Wu,,https://devpost.com/sohpei,sohpei,,Niya Xu,,https://devpost.com/xnyjjx,xnyjjx,,Carol Chu,,https://devpost.com/carolchu,carolchu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://devpost.com/software/mind-labyrinth-x5hpw8,mind-labyrinth-x5hpw8

So we thought up of a way to raise money (and continuously!) to help these people in need with the advent of a digital currency known as Monero. And the best part is that you don't even have to spend a single cent. Mine for Puerto Rico allows anyone who goes onto our website to dedicate a portion (anywhere from 0-100%) of their CPU processing power to mine for digital currency, allowing the user to use their computers at ease while they raise money for helping out this very urgent humanitarian crisis. The money will be stored into a digital wallet and so the more users we get to go onto the site, the more amount of money that gets generated! So to really make an impact (and we cannot stress this enough) this would have to be a COLLECTIVE EFFORT.

For the front-end, we used html, css for the display, and javascript/jquery to make the app more responsive. To handle the back-end, we explored a JSON-based database called Firebase, which uses AngularJS. Most of the native-app-plugins were installed using cordova, and we implemented different API's from google and firebase to polish our application. We initially thought about handling the back-end using PHP and MySQL through ajax queries in javacscript, we figured that it would be too complicated since cordova doesn't support PHP.

Three of the four group members on our team have only meddled with html enough to print out ""Hello World!"", let alone css, cordova, onsen, firebase, and angular js. It is safe to assume that the team spent 70% of the Hackathon learning the syntax and nature of each language. On top of which, many features we wanted to implement required heavy use of online APIs. I think at this point, every one of us feel like we've read textbooks worth of documentations.","Stress aside, we all really enjoyed coding pointME. The project started off as an off hand idea and evolved into something we are all very proud to present. Of course, we will continue to upgrade and refine the app. We have many more functions such as car-pooling, estimation time to destination, and having every event placed neatly in a calendar. Until it is ready enough for us to seriously consider the business side of it. Our goal is to release/sell the app early 2017.","pointME allows users to create an event, and upon doing so, this creates an appointment where the user can chat with other event attendees, share files, and get directions to the event location. Each appointment also has a shareable link that is used to invite others to the event through Facebook. Most importantly, the appointment shows the location of the attendees via geolocation prior to the event, allowing easy visualization of who will be able to make it to the appointment on time, which the organizer and others can see to avoid hectic group messaging.",https://hophacks-spring-2016.devpost.com/,pointME,"Often times, our phones “blow up” with notifications from last-minute messaging before an event or meeting. It’s difficult, especially for the organizer, to keep track of who is running late or may have to cancel last-minute. We wanted to create an event-planning app that would help avoid this hassle. The original idea actually sprouted from one of our teammates when he was running late for his meeting and he did not want to message the entire club.","Oh man, where do I begin? As mentioned before, the team members have definitely developed a much more indepth understanding of web-app development. From front end coding to UI organization to collecting back end data. We feel like we grasped a much better idea of this industry, gained a ton of respect for others and are very inspired to continue to work in this genre. I think the most valuable lesson we learned is just how effective a team can be when everyone is easy going and works diligently on their task.","We’re extremely proud of all the features we were able to implement, even with our limited experience in web-app development.

Using OneSheeld, a kind of Arduino shield, we were able to connect the phone to Arduino where we could call on camera functions to take the picture and Twitter functions to upload them. 
Essentially, in our code we had a while loop that called analogRead to continuously read the pressure sensors in order to check if the squirrel had stepped into the box. If the analogRead reading were below the threshold then thew turn flash off, take picture and upload to twitter functions were called. These three functions were placed within an if statement of the analog readings being lower than the threshold, so they would only be activated if the sensor was triggered.
